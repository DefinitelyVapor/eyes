# eyes
Eyes is a custom emoji pack for Discord and other chat applications which consists of manipulated versions of the original Discord eyes emoji.

The official Eyes Discord server can be found here:
https://discord.me/eyes

Feel free to check it out!
In the server, the channel #emotes should contain all of the emotes, but I'll list them all here as well.
